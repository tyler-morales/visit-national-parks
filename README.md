# Parkway‚Äì Visit National Parks

Parkway is the Goodreads for National Parks across America. Discover parks, save parks to you list of visited and want to visit places, and learn more about events near you. 

A full-stack web that helps outdoors enthusiasts discover and save their favorite National Parks across America, Parkway is the one stop shop to tracking and planning trips across the US. Leveraging the National Parks Service API in combination with Amazon Web Services, users are presented with beautifully displayed data from all 463 parks! Through Google social sign-in and email sign in, users can save the parks they‚Äôve visited and want to visit. Built from a love of the outdoors and having struggled to find accurate and unbiased information from sponsored blogs or articles, I decided to build a solution to finding every National Park in the US. Think of Parkway as the Goodreads for National Parks!

## üìñ Background

I love road tripping. On countless trips with friends and family it has been difficult to search for official parks sanctioned by the National Parks Service. Many of the websites I found were sponsored blogs that promoted already popular National Parks. What I and those around me wanted was a place to find the lesser traveled places. 

This is where Parkway was born. After a proof of concept MVP at Columbia college that myself and three of my classmates built, I took a break, but couldn't get this idea out of my mind. It wasn't until December of 2021, about six months after we pushed the first version when I started to rebuild the entire project from scratch. 

Fast forward to the last day of Februray 2022 and I've released a stable version of Parkway! More improvements are soon to follow, so be sure to come along me with this version. 

## üèÜ Goals

The two main goals of this project are to:

1. Build my technical knowledge on Next.js
2. Create a production website that REAL people can interact with and utilize


## üõ† Features

- üèó **Discover** every sansctioned National Park including National Seashores, Trails, Mounuments and more...
- üíæ **Save** all the parks you've visited or want to visit

Think of Parkway as the Goodreads for parks in America. View information for a park, and if it interests you, save it to your "Want to Visit" list or your "Visited List"

## üíª Tech Stack

| Front End      | Backend                           | Packages            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| React/ Next js | AWS Amplify (Hosting & CI/CD)     | Formik (Forms)      |
| Tailwind css   | AWS Cognito (User Authentication) | Mapbox              |
|                | AWS Dynamo DB (Database)          | Splitbee (Analytics)|
|                | GraphQL (API)                     |                     |

## üîÆ Future Features

1. **Social Users**
I would like to add the ability to allow users to search for their friends and family to see where they have visited. They could also add them to trips and plan group trips together

2. **Guides**
Currently, through the many blogs, there aren't unbiased accounts of what to do at National Parks. I think it would be great to have unbiased or park rangers give their advice to what to do at parks.
